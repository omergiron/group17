The Y&O website is a platform for selling jewelry. As part of our work, we have implemented features to view and add jewelry from the "Bracelets" category to the shopping cart.
As part of the project, we have developed three screens: the shopping cart page, the Bracelets page, and the home page, which includes a popup window for registration, login, and personal details.


1.	Upon entering the site, the home page opens. Click on the icon of a man in the top menu to log in as a user.
2.	If you are a registered user, fill in the details under "Sign In"; otherwise, register for the website under "Join". We perform comprehensive and thorough checks on these details.
3.	After logging in, the user will see a greeting in the top menu, displaying "Hello" followed by the user's name.
4.	To view your personal details saved on the site or to log out, click on the person icon in the top menu (this can be done from any page on the site).
5.	To browse the site and add jewelry to the shopping cart, click on the "Bracelets" category in the top menu.
6.	Upon clicking this category, you will be taken to the jewelry page. To add a piece of jewelry to the shopping cart, select the desired quantity and click the "Add To Cart" button. Clicking on a product image will open a window displaying an enlarged image.
7.	After clicking the "Add to Cart" button, a message will appear confirming or rejecting the addition. The addition will be rejected if the customer is not logged in to the website or if the product is not available in the desired quantity.
8.	You can view the products in the shopping cart by clicking on the cart icon in the top menu.
9.	Upon entering the shopping cart, messages about promotions and discounts on the website will appear. To dismiss these messages, click on the "X" button.
10.	You can make changes to the shopping cart by clicking on the "X" button next to the product you wish to remove. Each click of the "X" button will decrease the quantity of the item by one.
11.	 By clicking on the site's logo in the top menu, you will be redirected to the home page.
